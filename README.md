# Birds_PrincipalComponentAnalysis
Welcome to the Birds' Bone Dataset Analysis repository!. The project explores the fascinating world of birds' anatomy using the Birds' Bone dataset. With 420 birds representing various species, each characterized by 11 distinct bone measurements, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover essential patterns. By simplifying complex data, PCA helps identify key features, providing insights into the variability of bird bone characteristics.
